# Project Overview

This project focuses on using makefiles to automate the build process for a project.
Sometimes it takes alot of time to build the program manually for every change made
on its source files (dependencies). Automating the process, ensures that we achieve that
more efficienty with little time.

An understanding of makefies and how to define rules within the file is essential for
software emgineers.

This project therefore gives learners an undestanding of how to create and use makefiles.
A series of tasks have been provided to achieve this objective.
