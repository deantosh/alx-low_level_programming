# Project overview

Hash table is a data structure that is used to map key to their corresponding values.
This project will focus on working with hash tables to store and retrieve data. The aim
is to provide an understanding of how hash tables work and how to implement and use them.
A series of tasks are given to achieve these obectives.

## Tasks

 1. Task 0 - creates a hash table.
 2. Task 1 - create a hash function implementing the djb2 algorithm.
 3. Task 2 - create a function that returns the index of a key.
 4. Task 3 - create a function that adds an element to the hash table.
 5. Task 4 - create a function that retrieves a value associated with a key.
 6. Task 5 - create a function that prints a hash table.
 7. Task 6 - create a function that deletes a hash table.
 8. Task 7 - create a sorted hash table (advanced task).
